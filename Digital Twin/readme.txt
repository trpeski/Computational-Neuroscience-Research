This project aims to investigate whether initializing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
with weights derived from the Spike Time Tiling Coefficient (STTC)
values among neurons in the V1 area of a mouse's brain can improve the network's performance in predicting angles from video data.
The neurons are selected based on their high predictive power (HPP) for the angle and their statistically significant connections to neurons in layer 4.
The experiment compares the performance of the CNN initialized with STTC values to a CNN initialized with random weights, hypothesizing that the former will yield better accuracy.
